### Code conventions
We follow practices including Test Driven Development (red/green/refactor) and our goal is to maintain good code
coverage with our tests, so we strongly encourage you to test drive your code to help us with this goal. 

If you commit code and make a pull request, it will be reviewed by a trusted committer according to our
code/styling/testing standards.

### Fork and Pull
For this repo we use a standard Fork and Pull contributing model.  This is a good way to manage multiple, asynchronous
contributors.  Follow the steps in [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and you'll be on your
way!

After forking, remember to set up a remote that points to the upstream repository to keep your forked repo up-to-date.
[This article](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) goes through the steps of syncing your fork.

When you are ready to merge your change back in, open a pull request!
